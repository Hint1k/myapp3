# 🛡 Fraud Detection System (Project Plan)

## 📌 Overview
Fraud Detection System is a **planned microservices-based** application designed to **identify, prevent, and analyze fraudulent transactions** in real-time. This project aims to provide **REST APIs for external clients** while utilizing **Kafka for internal communication** among microservices.

The system will incorporate **risk scoring, and rule-based detection** to flag suspicious activities. Fraud analysts will be able to **search fraudulent transactions** using **Elasticsearch** and **generate reports stored in S3** for audits.

🚧 **This project is currently in early development phase. ** 🚧

## 🎯 **Planned Features**

### ✅ **1. REST API for Fraud Detection & Reporting**
- The system will expose **secure RESTful endpoints** for external clients (banks, fintech, e-commerce platforms) to submit and retrieve transaction data.
- API authentication will be handled via **JWT with Spring Security**.
- **Rate limiting with Redis** will be implemented to prevent API abuse.

### 🔗 **2. Kafka-Based Microservices Communication**
- The microservices will communicate asynchronously using **Apache Kafka**.
- When a transaction is processed, an event will be published to Kafka.
- The Fraud Detection Service will listen to these events and apply **rule-based fraud detection**.

### 📊 **3. Fraud Investigation via Elasticsearch**
- Flagged transactions will be stored in **Elasticsearch** for fast searching and filtering.
- Fraud analysts will be able to search based on:
  - Customer ID
  - Transaction amount
  - Risk score
  - Location, etc.
- **Kibana dashboards** will be used for visualization.

### 📂 **4. S3-Based Report Storage**
- Fraud analysts will be able to generate fraud reports (CSV, PDF) via an API.
- Reports will be **securely stored in AWS S3** (or **MinIO** for local development).
- **Presigned URLs** will be generated for secure & time-limited access.

### 🔥 **5. Real-time Risk Scoring**
- A rule-based risk scoring system will be implemented.
- Transactions will be classified based on **weighted risk factors**.
- The system may integrate with **external fraud detection APIs**.

### ⚡ **6. Caching with Redis**
- Frequently accessed fraud data will be cached in **Redis** for **fast retrieval**.
- This will reduce **database load** and improve API performance.

### 🔒 **7. Security & Compliance**
- **Spring Security + JWT** will be used for authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** will restrict access for fraud analysts, admins, and API clients.
- **Audit logging** will be implemented for compliance and monitoring.
